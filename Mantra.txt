1. Quality over quantity
   OPTIMIZE!!!
2. Backward compatibility is for the weak
   (i.e. If mod shit breaks, that's none of the engine developers' problems.)
   - There's a sight chance it breaks
   - I can break
   - Expect it to break
   - It will likely break
   - It WILL break
   - EVERYTHING WILL be broken
3. Have something solid (for the current version only). Exception handling is mandatory. Every corner case
   is an important case.
   Also, save files should be unbreakable.
