# Documentation

A game engine with bad documentation is a bad engine, so here are lots of docs!

Markdown-formatted documents use [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) extensions, as well as few other extensions such as Table Of Contents' `[[TOC]]`. These documents are edited using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/).

Code documentation generation is done through Doxygen.
